Various programs I wrote in high school that are slightly interpreter-dependent

`from binary (slow).bf`
----------------------
Convert binary to ASCII explicitly by exponentiating each bit


`from binary (fast).bf`
----------------------
Convert binary to ASCII under the assumption that the MSB has value 128


`to binary.bf`
----------------------
Convert ASCII to binary representation


`sentinel.bf`
----------------------
Upon entering a string terminated with a ',', outputs "Hacking [string]".
This looked a lot cooler on my phone's interpreter.
